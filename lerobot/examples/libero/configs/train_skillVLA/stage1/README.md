# Stage-1 training

The three Stage-1 components are independent jobs. Edit shared dataset/model
inputs in [`stage1_common_config.yaml`](stage1_common_config.yaml), then edit
the component-specific YAML and run its launcher:

| Component | Config | Launcher | New output location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VSA | `VSA/vsa_train_config.yaml` | `VSA/submit_train.sh [architecture]` | `outputs_root/skillVLA_stage1/VSA/<run>` |
| Skill Predictor | `Predictor/predictor_train_config.yaml` | `Predictor/submit_train.sh` | `outputs_root/skillVLA_stage1/Predictor/<run>` |
| Terminator | `Terminator/terminator_train_config.yaml` | `Terminator/submit_train.sh` | `outputs_root/skillVLA_stage1/Terminator/<run>` |

Each launcher snapshots its own YAML, the shared YAML, and the global cluster
YAML before submission. Nested fields in a component config override shared
fields. For example, Terminator can set `dataset.relabeled` without changing
VSA or Predictor. Predictor PT training always uses original skill labels.

`VSA/submit_train.sh` is the VSA launcher itself (shared code in `src/`); the old
`stage1/submit_train.sh` + `stage1_train_config.yaml` pair was removed.
`terminator/submit_train.sh` still backs the Predictor and Terminator launchers.
No existing checkpoints or logs are moved. Downstream resolvers accept both old
and new run locations by run name.

## Direct / Residual layer split

For `direct_patch_1..6`, `residual_patch_1..6`, and their `_dGD` variants,
`architecture.visual_bridge_last_n_layers` accepts 1..17. The first `18-N`
Expert layers predict the 4H motion base; the last `N` layers process its
current H-token slice and each read their corresponding Cond bottleneck.
For example, `1` keeps the existing 17+1 split and run name, while `9` selects
9+9 and adds `_layer9` after the architecture label in the run name.
`_dGD` detaches the action path at the selected split. FT and evaluation
inherit the split from the checkpoint without another setting.
